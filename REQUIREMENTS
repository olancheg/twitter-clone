I would like to see how you'd build the following Twitter thingy in Rails:

Build an app, where a user can log in and perhaps edit his account (username, real name etc.)

The following features needs to be available to the user:

  - Add friend (from other users)
  - Remove friend (from friend list)

  - Post a message
  - Show all messages from friends

  - Ability to lookup another user and see his posts

You might add the following as well:

  - A user can block another user, so that other user can't see his posts or add him as friend
  - Users can comment on posts

Please send this back to me once completed.
